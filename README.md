# Chess Tourney
Online multiplayer chess games are very common on the web nowadays. What we aim to attain is a web application where it is possible to play chess against several (simulated or not) players, and also where one can monitor the games (which can happen simultaneously), and see detailed information about each game, like the time each player as spent thinking on his moves, how many moves had they made so far, etc. This type of information can be retrieved from not only the games taking place at the moment, but also the ones that have already terminated (game/tournament history). Each game is a 1 vs 1 game. The games happen in real time, and can happen simultaneously. Each game is timed, meaning, there is a cronometer for every game, to control the time spent and additional time gained by each player. In case of a tournament, as usual, the winner goes on to the next phase until a champion is found.

## Architecture
The architecture can be divided into 3 sections: two smaller sections of interation with the users, and a bigger section that portrays the handling of the data.

 The two smaller sections consist of the Unity application where the games are actually played, and the web interface where users cab see the information about the games/tournaments played on Chess Tourney.

 The third section however is the actual meat of the pie. To handle the complex problem of handling what we have to assume, could an enormous amount of data, we adopt a divide and conquer strategy, aproaching the issue with a micro-services solution. All the information generated by the players using the unity application goes through a broker (in the case of Chess Tourney, we'll be using Kafka) which will then relay to multiple docker containers, which with a specific task, for example, a container that tracks the games being played at the current time, a container that dumps the information into the database, to assure its persistency, or a glassfish container to make the bridge between the previously mentioned web interface and the rest of the system.
